Input:

drug_a.csv, drug_b.csv and cell_line.csv are feature matrices generated by matlab.

drug_names.csv, cell_line_names.csv and 39_cellines_information.csv is used to generate tables,
which contains the names rather than labels.

train_labels.txt is used to calculate positive and negative sample size of each cell line.

The tensor is also needed for the codes in final_model.ipynb


Output:

miss_pre.txt is the predicted probability of missing pairs, note that, since the existing of 
symmetrical pairs the size doubles.

final_result_pre_miss.csv is the table with drug pairs regarded as positive.
Note that the drug pair is considered positive when one of the symmetrical 
pairs has probability above 0.5. The table also has the probability of the 
higher probability of the two probability of symmetrical pairs.

cell_line_pos_neg.csv is the table containing the information of the positive
and negative sample size of each cell line. 

miss_pre_pos_neg.csv is the table containing the information of the positive and negative
sample size of the missing pairs for each cell line.



I write some comments in the final_model.ipynb to help interpret the codes I wrote.
