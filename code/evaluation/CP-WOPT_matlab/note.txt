Input: 

test pairs of 100 experiments

the tensor without NA, which is generated by R, these data are not
given in this folder, they are in the folder /data_preprocess/output/
tensor_without_na/




Output:

drug_a.csv, drug_b.csv and cell_line.csv are features to be used next by 
python and the results of CP-WOPT.

cpwopt_true.csv are the synergy scores of test pairs.
cpwopt_pre.csv are the tensor scores calculated by CP-WOPT of test pairs.
cpwopt_true.csv and cpwopt_pre.csv will be processed by python later.

cpwopt_pre_missing.csv are the tensor scores calculated by CP-WOPT of missing pairs.

Note that the order of the synergy scores of test pairs are different from the 
test_labels in python. So the situation of CP-WOPT is different from other three models 
when handling in python. You can notice that in my python codes.


Description:
The read_data is used to read the result of R, the preprocessed tensor. 
Note to modify the path of the data whiling trying to run the code. 
The final_exp_100 incoporates read_data, which is to implement CP-WOPT 
on the tensor. For each experiment, final_exp_100 uses the stratify samples 
generated by python to set approximate 40% of the existing data for every cell
line to missing on purpose to be test sets. Also note to modify the path of files
if trying to run the code on your own PC.
