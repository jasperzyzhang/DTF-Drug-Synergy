## Evaluation Process:

I repeated stratify sampling 100 times. And feed the features to other machine learning models,
namely random forest and logistic regression to compare with the deep neural network, whih is employed 
in the DTF model. The CP-WOPT classifier is also considered to be compared with other models.
The test pairs and the performances of four classifers are given.
