Folders exp1-100 contain the test pairs generated by python, using 
stratify sampling and the output of python and matlab.

Folder output_of_100_exps contain results derived from 
100 experiments.

all_acc_ave.txt is the average acc of 100 experiments of model DTF for each cell line.
all_auc_ave.txt is the average auc of 100 experiments of model DTF for each cell line.



The model name is same as before.

*_fpr.txt is the false positive rate of model *, which collects all the samples of 100 experiments.
*_tpr.txt is the true positive rate of model *, which collects all the samples of 100 experiments.
Both of these are used to draw roc curve for 100 experiment.

miss_index is a global parameter, I save it here.
